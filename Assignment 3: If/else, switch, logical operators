1.What are the boolean values in your language? (e.g., True and False, true and false, 1, and 0,etc)
    True and False/true and false
    
2. What types of conditional statements are available in your language? (if/else, if/then/else, if/elseif/else). Does your language allow for statements other than “if” (for example, Perl has an “unless” statement, which does the opposite of “if”!)
    Conditional statements in PHP are if, if...else, if...elseif...else, switch. PHP doesn't allow for statements other than "if".
    
3. Does your language use short-circuit evaluation? Include an example of the shor-circuit logic working or not working (or both, if your language is like Java and supports both!)
    Yes, PHP use short-circuit evaluation. 
    $a = 'str';
    $b = 1;
    $b >1 ||$a .= 'yes';
    $b == 1 ||$a .='no';
    echo $a . PHP_EOL;
    die
    [1]
4. How does your programming language deal with the “dangling else” problem?
   PHP's solution to "dangling else" is to put the later "if" in the compound statement.

5. If your language supports switch or case statements, do you have to use “break” to get out of them? Can you use “continue” to have all of them evaluated?
    PHP supports Switch or case statements, you can use "continue", if you want to specify to jump out of the "n" recycle, you can add a number after "continue".

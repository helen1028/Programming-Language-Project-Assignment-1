1. Does your language include multiple types of loops (while, do/while, for, foreach)? If so, what are they and how do they differ from each other?
  PHP does include mutiple types of loop. PHP's for loop and while loop are similar to the for loop and while loop in java. They are both for(){},while(){}.

2. What is the syntax for declaring a function in your language?
  Specify the function name followed by the function keyword.[1]

3. Are there any rules about where the function has to be placed in your code file so that it can run?
  The PHP function rules require: a valid function name starts with a letter or underscore, followed by any number of letters, numbers or underscores.[2]

4. Does your language support recursive functions?
  Yes, PHP does support recursive functions.

5. Can functions in your language accept multiple parameters? Can they be of different data types?
  According to the manual, PHP functions can accept up to 12 parameters.[3]

6. Can functions in your language return multiple values at the same time? How is that implemented? If not, are there ways around that problem? What are they?
  PHP doesn't support to return multiple values in a function.[4] We can create an array and return the array to return multiple values in PHP.

7. Is your language pass-by reference or value? Check your code against outside sources in case there is anything tricky going on (like in Perl).
  PHP supports both pass by value and pass by reference.[5]

8. Are there any other aspects of functions in your language that aren't specifically asked about
here, but that are important to know in order to write one? What are they?
  PHP function names are not case sensitive, so the F() and f() methods are the same and they all become constructors.
